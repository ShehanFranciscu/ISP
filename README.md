To create the tool we hope to develop, we had to study the methodology used in creating vulnerability scanning tools. There we decided to develop it in 4 parts, considering the ease of planning and its quality: information gathering, technical development, testing, and review.

Our first part of developing our product was the Information Gathering part where we had to analyze about 40 Research Papers. In the end, we both came to a final decision as to what kind of product our product should be.

Our 2nd part is the technical development part where we expect to start developing our research base product. We have decided to use GitHub, and we hope to gradually create our research base product using the source code of various open-source scanning tools available on GitHub. And we expect that we use the Python Language for this.

This will include 4 major functioning tools:

#Clickjacjing detection scanner
#Network Scanner
#XSS Scanner
#Wordpress Scanner

The 3rd part of our research-based product is the test part. we aim to check if the product we have developed works properly. There we hope to test the source code and all other functions of the tool under various conditions.

In the review phase, we checked our overall process and make sure all the expectancies are achieved. If anything, new to add to our product, it will implement near future.
